    sh ./scripts/build.sh
    ```
1. Run docker container using command: 
    ```
    sh ./scripts/run.sh
    ```
1. Run initial dataset processing:
    1. Get into docker container:
        ```
        docker exec -it transactions_fraud_detection_con bash    
        ```
   1. Run script with data preprocessing:
        ```
        python src/preprocessing/initial_preprocessing.py
        ``` 
        **Note:** You can run this script also outside the container, but make sure you have python with `pandas` library installed. 

## Dataset

To solve our problem of transactions fraud detection, we are using the data from [IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ieee-fraud-detection/overview) competition at Kaggle. The large-scale dataset contains real-world e-commerce transactions with a variety of features included. Features are of different types. describing transactions, products or other useful information (such as categorical `DeviceType`). Many of the features are not described properly, so results explanation will not be so clear.
